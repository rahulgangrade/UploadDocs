What were the challenges with the existing (legacy) framework?

The legacy tool does not allow users to create test cases using customized or business-driven test data.

The legacy tool requires strong technical expertise and scripting knowledge to design, modify, or extend test scenarios.

The legacy tool does not support validation of intermediate field values during the execution of an end-to-end flow.

The legacy tool lacks side-by-side comparison of expected versus actual files, making result analysis manual and error-prone.

End-to-end payment flows are not fully validated across all upstream and downstream systems within the POL ecosystem.

The legacy tool does not provide rule-level coverage or visibility, resulting in gaps in business rule validation.

Optional (More Executive / One-Line Summary)

The existing framework is heavily script-dependent, lacks business-level configurability, and does not provide comprehensive end-to-end validation or rule coverage.
